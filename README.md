Welcome to my web development repository! Here, you will find a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets, concepts, and resources that I have compiled during my time as a Web Development student at Ada School. This repository is designed to serve as a helpful resource for anyone looking to learn or refresh their skills in web development.
